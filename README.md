spotify-mp3-downloader
======================

This is a node.js program that is controlled by a web interface. It downloads .mp3 files from Spotify and ID3-tags them accordingly.

**You need a Spotify Premium account to use this.**

# How to use:

1. Install Node.js http://nodejs.org/
2. (Only if you run OS X) Install id3lib `brew install id3lib` (If you don't have brew yet: http://brew.sh)
3. Run `node app.js` from the command line
This will open your browser. If it does not, navigate to http://localhost:1717.
4. Drag spotify tracks from the Spotify desktop client to the website

# Legal etc.
Spotify prohibits downloading music from their service, so using this tool is not really allowed and you might risk ending up with a suspended account. I am not resposible for any of that :)
